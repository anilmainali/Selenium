# Selenium
# Welcome to my Selenium Repo

This Repo will be used as a tutorial on How To Get Started with Selenium.

## What is Selenium

-Open Source.FREE

-Used for Web Based Applications.

-Works On Multiple Operating Systems.Windows,Mac OSX,Linux,Soraris

## Prerequisite
1. Set up your environment to run the Selenium script.

## Set up your environment to run the Selenium Script.
First, let us be clear that there is no such tool called "Selenium".we do not need to install Selenium. All we have to do is to download Selenium jars , Import and configure Selenium Jars into Project.

Since we will be write the selenium scripts using Java so we need to pick up some kind of editor to run our Java Code. For this we can  download Eclipse or IntelliJ to run our Java code.

In this tutorial, we will be using Eclipse IDE as our editor.So,first thing first we need to download java.

So you must be clear now that there is no such tool as selenium we need to set up Selenium by downloading and installing independent tools so that we can write Selenium scripts.

Let's get started:

## Installing and Configuration instructions to Setup Selenium.

## Step 1 : Download Java JRE and Java Deveopment Kit(JDK)
Question before you get started: Is Java JRE and Java Development Kit (JDK) Free to Download?

Answer: Yes, you can download it from Oracle Official website.

Inorder to download and install JRE and Java Development Kit(JDK) you can navigate to <a href="http://softwaretestingcafe.com/how-to-download-and-install-java-development-kit-jdk/"> Anil Mainali's Blog Post.</a> where you can follow the step by step tutorial on how to download and intall Java Development Kit on your Windows 7.

## Step 2 : Set Environmental Variables
Inorder to Set Environmental Variables, you can navigate to <a href="http://softwaretestingcafe.com/how-to-set-the-path-and-environment-variables-in-windows-7/?preview=true"> Anil Mainali's Blog Post.</a> where you can follow the step by step tutorial on how to Set Environmental Variables on your Windows 7.

## Step 3 : Download Eclipse or IntelliJ
For this tutorial we are going to Download and install Eclipse IDE.For the complete step by step tutorial navigate to <a href="http://softwaretestingcafe.com/how-to-download-eclipse-neon-on-windows-7/"> Anil Mainali's Blog Post.

## Step 4 :Open Eclipse IDE for the first time.
Navigate to the directory folder where you downloaded and saved your Eclipse.

Click on **eclipse.exe** file

It will open a Eclipse launcher where you have a option to select a directory where you want to save your work.

Either leave the default (in my case C:\users\Mainali\workspace) and Click OK. Or browse to the folder where you want to save your work and click OK.

It will load the Eclipse and will launch the welcome screen.

Click on Create a new Java Project link.

It will open a new Project dialog where you have to enter the Project Name and click on Finish.

You will be presented with an Eclipse interface with your project name , src and Java library.

## Step 5 :Download Selenium Jars
Navigate to the Selenium official website: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

Under Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings, click on Download Link next to Java.

Selenium-Java-3.3.1-Zip will be downloaded.

Note: This will be downloaded as a zip file.

Click on the downloaded zip or Click on dropdown arrow and select and click on show in folder.

Unzip the file
 You have successfully downloaded the Selenium jar on your computer. Follow the next section to import  the selenium jar into your project.
 
 Note: Make a note of where you have downloaded your file. In my case, I have saved in C:\Users\Mainali\Downloads\selenium-java-3.3.1

## Step 6 :Import Selenium Jars into Project.

Open you Eclipse IDE and create a new projectby right clicking into project explorer section.

Select new and click on other then java project.

Click on Next.

Provide a project name for Example easyTravel Project.

Open the library folder.

Select all the jars by pressing Ctrl + A and click on Open
